<p style="margin-bottom:-25em;"> Donate Life is a non-profit organisation of people who are willing to make the world a better place to live in. We were established on December 4, 2014.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Mr. Nilesh Mandlewala who has dedicated his life to this cause since 2005<br> and with the support of other founder trustees, it has been our constant endeavour to contribute to <br> the best abilities to this noble initiative.</p>

<p>There are over 20 lakh patients waiting for a kidney transplant in India - 2 lakh being added to <br> that number every year. The number for various other organs like heart, liver, eyes are equally <br> shocking. This worrisome situation has strengthened our resolve to save as many lives as we can.</p>

<p>As of Today, we at Donate Life have procured 464 Kidneys, 199 Livers, 8 Pancreas, 45 Hearts, <br> 34 Lungs, 4 Hands & 362 Cornea, and a total of 1117 Organs and Tissue donations  which gave <br> new lease of life and vision to 1025 organ failure patients in our country and globe.</p>

<p>Donate Life is the pioneer for the first ever successful cadaver heart transfer and transplant in <br> Western India. Donate Life is also the pioneer in first ever inter state heart transplant from Surat, <br> Gujarat to Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Indore, Madhya Pradesh.</p>

<p>Donate Life is also responsible for carrying out the first-ever bone donation, successfully from <br> Gujarat. 45% of the cadaveric kidney & liver transplants at Institute Of Kidney Disease & <br>Research  Centre in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 20% of the heart transplants at Mumbai's Fortis Hospital <br> have taken place due to the efforts of our organisation. Also, out of the 5 heart transplants <br> that have taken place at Ahmedabad's CIMS hospital, 3 have been donated from Surat through Donate Life.</p><br>

<p>We are committed to spreading awareness for the importance of cadaver organ donation. We were established for two purposes:
<br>
- To spread awareness and make cadaver donation possible, by increasing the number of cadaver organ donations in India and facilitating the entire process.
<br>
- To prevent the alarming number of kidney and liver failure cases that happen in India and also provide them with a new lease of life.</p>
